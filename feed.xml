                        <description>Property development in Exeter city centre is routinely displacing independent shops, creating significant risk and cost for affected businesses. Recent casualties include The Real Food Store, Hyde+Seek and The Exeter Barber Shop, which will soon have to move for the second time in three years. Is Exeter a good place to start a small retail business?</description>

                        <description>Stalled South West devolution has allowed organisations to propose arbitrary spatial frames that suit their competing regional leadership agendas. The resulting confusion of brands has in turn allowed policy-makers to outline super-regional strategies that overlook distinct place-based development needs without improving public funding prospects.</description>
