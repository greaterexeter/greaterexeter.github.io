Our approach is:</p><ul><li>agile - using lean, low cost, minimum viable mechanisms to get results quickly and efficiently</li><li>experimental - adopting innovative participative methodologies to stimulate full spectrum engagement</li><li>peer to peer - leveraging network effects to communicate compelling common interest change narratives</li><li>open source - sharing evidenced insight and information to enhance deliberation and decision-making</li><li>modular - designing standalone tools for reuse across contexts and topics</li><li>whole system - transcending silos and spheres to simultaneously address multiple barriers to change.</li></ul><p>Greater Exeter CIC intends to enable the novel, place-based, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder approach that is needed to address the region's challenges, demonstrate its viability and strategic relevance with high quality participatory action research, and leverage its adoption using effective advocacy and communications.</p></article></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"><h3>Manifesto</h3></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-1"><article id="think-local-act-global"><h4>Think local, act global</h4><p>Globalisation has presented complex challenges that do not recognise local, national or international authority remits or jurisdictions. They exceed the reach of democratic mandates and corporate strategies, eluding NGOs and charities as much as community groups and individual citizens. Nor can deregulated markets or unimpeded capital resolve their contradictions.</p><p>Social cohesion is at risk while centralised governance and confusion over the role of the state and public/private finance undermines effective intervention.</p><p>Rather than relying on remote policy-makers to serve local interests, the scale at which people live, work, form families and participate in communities offers the most appropriate basis on which to address these issues.</p><p>A place-based perspective helps reduce complexity, enabling joined-up thinking about local needs and achievable action to answer them. Instead of relying on governance alone to solve problems, individuals and organisations of all shapes and sizes can work together around common interest in the place they share.</p><p>Rather than local action requiring global insight, the reverse is true. The formal and informal relationships that constitute communities can foster unique solutions to specific local challenges that cross sectoral and institutional boundaries, creating exportable models for constructive change elsewhere.</p><p>Understanding the collaborative potential of place helps leverage public, private and community resources so we become greater together than the sum of our individual parts, renewing the social contract and enhancing our resilience in the face of a changing world. Then no-one gets left behind and everyone prospers together.</p></article></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"><h3>Mission</h3></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-1"><article id="challenges-and-opportunities"><h4>Challenges &amp; opportunities</h4><p>All localities face place-specific challenges, while also possessing unique characteristics with the potential to help address them.</p><p>Exeter has developed rapidly during the past decade, significantly outperforming the region to become its principal economic engine and the UK's fastest growing city.</p><p>However, not all the claims that are made about its strengths represent differentiating advantages when compared with its competitors, and many structural weaknesses remain. Partisan perspectives, institutional exceptionalism and insufficient policy co-ordination all undermine the region's ability to meet its needs.</p><p>Making the most of Greater Exeter's opportunities requires realistic insight into its place in the world, shared strategic vision for its future and the courage to collaborate in pursuit of novel ideas with truly transformative potential.</p><p>Instead of following sector-specific routes to competing Whitehall department silos and beyond in pursuit of shrinking public investment, the region must reinvent itself and find new routes to prosperity on its own terms.</p><p>As the world divides into winners and losers, and restlessly-roaming venture capital arrives to &quot;disrupt&quot; established businesses in search of rapacious returns, business as usual is no longer an option. Risks are proliferating, some with particular potential for adverse local impact.</p><p>Seeking to emulate existing success stories from elsewhere without understanding the differences between here and there is unlikely to work. A population bigger than Bristol distributed across an area larger than London and extensive interdependence between city and satellites are exceptional qualities, among others.</p><p>Recognising their value while rising to meet the challenges they present head on requires the kind of familiarity that only comes with physical proximity and the kind of commitment that results from a real stake in the future. Who is better placed to create a prosperous Greater Exeter than the people who live and work here?</p></article></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"><h3>Agenda</h3></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-1"><article id="insight-vision-impact"><h4>Insight, Vision, Impact</h4><p>Social change organisations often present bespoke theories of change that inform their approach as reassuringly symmetric diagrams which purport to capture complex systems in simple structures. While such abstractions necessarily cannot accurately capture the real world, outline frameworks can nevertheless offer useful working models and practice guides.</p><p>Greater Exeter CIC's work is therefore broadly informed by a three stage theory of change which offers a pragmatic road map capable of getting us from where we are to where we need to be.</p><section id="insight"><h5>Insight</h5><p><em>&quot;There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true&quot;</em> - Søren Kierkegaard</p><p>However well-intentioned, peering through the wrong end of a telescope can produce parochial points of view that play well in filter bubbles but do not persuade those with broader perspective. Unreliable sources can also undermine understanding by supporting attractive but misleading claims, while contrary observations are easily overlooked when they challenge established consensus, even if the evidence bears them out.</p><p>Instead, significant differentiating insights based on realistic strategic appraisal and rigorous situational analysis are needed to challenge assumptions and deliver a clarity check. Reassessing recontextualised objectives and considering them against projected future scenarios generates strategic intelligence that offers real insight into the bigger picture in greater detail.</p></section><section id="vision"><h5>Vision</h5><p><em>&quot;Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come&quot;</em> - Victor Hugo</p><p>On its own, no amount of insight will do anything other than reveal the situation as it already is. The imagination to renew strategic vision at the limits of what is possible is also required, alongside open-minded, lateral enquiry to discover interventions with real potential to create prosperity in a complex, changing world.</p><p>Novel approaches that provide demonstrable, measurable benefits elsewhere can be skilfully translated to meet specific local challenges, offering compelling evidence-based change narratives capable of catalysing active stakeholder engagement around concrete opportunities for collaborative impact.</p></section><section id="impact"><h5>Impact</h5><p><em>&quot;Ideas change the course of history&quot;</em> - John Maynard Keynes</p><p>Effective impact intervention to implement renewed vision depends on inclusive future-oriented thought leadership to facilitate common purpose around new, incentivising ideas. Previously intractable challenges can become opportunities to establish new alignments around productive innovation, driving constructive change.</p><p>Participative methodologies which systematically test and measure repeatable, real-world outcomes help avoid blue pie in the sky thinking and support solutions brokerage by demonstrating how a better world looks in practice. They also provide for potential export of successful interventions.</p><p>Decision-makers and wider consultation process participants gain better understanding of local problems and their potential solutions, organisations benefit from greater strategic alignment and cross-sector collaboration, and more inclusive economic policies distribute prosperity more equally and enhance regional resilience for all.</p></section></article></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"><h3>Method</h3></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-1"><article id="participatory-action-research"><h4>Participatory action research</h4><p>Greater Exeter CIC employs reflexive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_action_research">participatory action research</a> methods to ensure stakeholder perspectives and preferences are incorporated in individual projects and at organisational and methodological level.</p><p>The aim is to challenge the status quo while recognising its strengths; advocate strategic direction which acknowledges risk and uncertainty; maintain vision without losing sight of detail; explore leading-edge options alongside established solutions; and remain critically reflective while favouring bold, experimental action.</p><p>A wide range of research and advocacy tools are available to help achieve these aims. These include:</p><ul><li>stakeholder mapping and channel monitoring to facilitate engagement and information exchange</li><li>horizon scanning for emerging practices, standout ideas and innovative solutions</li><li>collaborative policy and practice development in roundtable discussions and focus groups</li><li>community participatory budgeting and planning facilitation</li><li>evidence-gathering via desk-based and field research, personal interviews and sample surveys</li><li>dissemination events including seminars, presentations, meetings and workshops</li><li>research and policy briefings, reports and papers, editorial content and news updates.</li></ul><p>Outputs are framed as potential social, economic and political capital to help leverage strategic interest alignment among key actors, and community interest is ensured through continuous feedback invitations.</p></article></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"><h3>Approach</h3></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-1"><article id="single-issues-complex-systems"><h4>Single issues, complex systems</h4><p>The whole regional policy puzzle cannot be solved with a single move. There are, moreover, competing views of what it looks like when complete. Nevertheless, a complex systems approach is necessary to avoid the limiting single-sector focus that characterises much current policy research and practice.</p><p>Greater Exeter CIC accordingly seeks to deal with issues individually, at appropriate spatial scale and sectoral scope, while recognising their unique position in the larger scheme. The interdependency of each piece of the puzzle is framed and resolved at the whole picture level of place. Each piece renders essential detail that cannot be captured in an overarching vision without losing sight of important information. Standing back from the emergent image offers an impression of the whole landscape.</p><p>Social, economic and political agency is distributed across the landscape in the same way as pieces fit together to complete the puzzle. The complexity of multiple cross-sectoral stakeholder roles and the frequency with which actors play parts in individual issues is reflected in the self-similarity of shapes and colours.</p><p>When a particular issue is correctly located in appropriate spatial and sectoral context, its solution offers potential insight into another similar problem elsewhere. Place-based interventions thus combine across many locations at multiple scales with complex whole system impact. Local action <em>can</em> solve global challenges.</p></article></div></div></div></section><section id="contact"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"><h3>Contact</h3></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-1"><h4>Something to say?</h4><p>Would you like to find out more, leave a comment, offer to contribute or get involved?</p><p>Drop us a line below or say hello on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/greaterexeter">@greaterexeter</a>.
