    <h4>Sustainable productive prosperity</h4>
    <p>Greater Exeter CIC is an independent not-for-profit social enterprise dedicated to creating sustainable productive prosperity for all who live and work in and around Exeter.</p>
    <p>Our aim is the fostering and furtherance of place-specific strategies that combine social, economic and environmental considerations to create positive outcomes that benefit all sections of the community.</p>
    <p>We also aim to enable more inclusive participation in regional strategic policy development and implementation while facilitating constructive collaboration between private, public and third sector decision-makers, business networks, community groups, advocacy, campaigning and non-profit organisations, charities, social enterprises, residents, workers and visitors.</p>
    <p>The focus is practical impact that will make a difference in everyday lives. Our approach is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>agile - using lean, low cost, minimum viable mechanisms to get results quickly and efficiently</li>
        <li>experimental - adopting innovative participative methodologies to stimulate full spectrum engagement</li>
        <li>peer to peer - leveraging network effects to communicate compelling common interest change narratives</li>
        <li>open source - sharing evidenced insight and information to enhance deliberation and decision-making</li>
        <li>modular - designing standalone tools for reuse across contexts and topics</li>
        <li>whole system - transcending silos and spheres to simultaneously address multiple barriers to change.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Greater Exeter CIC intends to enable the novel, place-based, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder approach that is needed to address the region's challenges, demonstrate its viability and strategic relevance with high quality participatory action research, and leverage its adoption using effective advocacy and communications.</p>

<article id="think-local-act-global">
    <h4>Think local, act global</h4>
    <p>Globalisation has presented complex challenges that do not recognise local, national or international authority remits or jurisdictions. They exceed the reach of democratic mandates and corporate strategies, eluding NGOs and charities as much as community groups and individual citizens. Nor can deregulated markets or unimpeded capital resolve their contradictions.</p>
    <p>Social cohesion is at risk while centralised governance and confusion over the role of the state and public/private finance undermines effective intervention.</p>
    <p>Rather than relying on remote policy-makers to serve local interests, the scale at which people live, work, form families and participate in communities offers the most appropriate basis on which to address these issues.</p>
    <p>A place-based perspective helps reduce complexity, enabling joined-up thinking about local needs and achievable action to answer them. Instead of relying on governance alone to solve problems, individuals and organisations of all shapes and sizes can work together around common interest in the place they share.</p>
    <p>Rather than local action requiring global insight, the reverse is true. The formal and informal relationships that constitute communities can foster unique solutions to specific local challenges that cross sectoral and institutional boundaries, creating exportable models for constructive change elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Understanding the collaborative potential of place helps leverage public, private and community resources so we become greater together than the sum of our individual parts, renewing the social contract and enhancing our resilience in the face of a changing world. Then no-one gets left behind and everyone prospers together.</p>

<article id="challenges-and-opportunities">
    <h4>Challenges &amp; opportunities</h4>
    <p>All localities face place-specific challenges, while also possessing unique characteristics with the potential to help address them.</p>
    <p>Exeter has developed rapidly during the past decade, significantly outperforming the region to become its principal economic engine and the UK's fastest growing city.</p>
    <p>However, not all the claims that are made about its strengths represent differentiating advantages when compared with its competitors, and many structural weaknesses remain. Partisan perspectives, institutional exceptionalism and insufficient policy co-ordination all undermine the region's ability to meet its needs.</p>
    <p>Making the most of Greater Exeter's opportunities requires realistic insight into its place in the world, shared strategic vision for its future and the courage to collaborate in pursuit of novel ideas with truly transformative potential.</p>
    <p>Instead of following sector-specific routes to competing Whitehall department silos and beyond in pursuit of shrinking public investment, the region must reinvent itself and find new routes to prosperity on its own terms.</p>
    <p>As the world divides into winners and losers, and restlessly-roaming venture capital arrives to &quot;disrupt&quot; established businesses in search of rapacious returns, business as usual is no longer an option. Risks are proliferating, some with particular potential for adverse local impact.</p>
    <p>Seeking to emulate existing success stories from elsewhere without understanding the differences between here and there is unlikely to work. A population bigger than Bristol distributed across an area larger than London and extensive interdependence between city and satellites are exceptional qualities, among others.</p>
    <p>Recognising their value while rising to meet the challenges they present head on requires the kind of familiarity that only comes with physical proximity and the kind of commitment that results from a real stake in the future. Who is better placed to create a prosperous Greater Exeter than the people who live and work here?</p>

    <h4>Insight, Vision, Impact</h4>
    <p>Social change organisations often present bespoke theories of change that inform their approach as reassuringly symmetric diagrams which purport to capture complex systems in simple structures. While such abstractions necessarily cannot accurately capture the real world, outline frameworks can nevertheless offer useful working models and practice guides.</p>
    <p>Greater Exeter CIC's work is therefore broadly informed by a three stage theory of change which offers a pragmatic road map capable of getting us from where we are to where we need to be.</p>

    <section id="insight">
        <h5>Insight</h5>
        
        
        
        <p><em>&quot;There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true&quot;</em> - Søren Kierkegaard</p>
        <p>However well-intentioned, peering through the wrong end of a telescope can produce parochial points of view that play well in filter bubbles but do not persuade those with broader perspective. Unreliable sources can also undermine understanding by supporting attractive but misleading claims, while contrary observations are easily overlooked when they challenge established consensus, even if the evidence bears them out.</p>
        <p>Instead, significant differentiating insights based on realistic strategic appraisal and rigorous situational analysis are needed to challenge assumptions and deliver a clarity check. Reassessing recontextualised objectives and considering them against projected future scenarios generates strategic intelligence that offers real insight into the bigger picture in greater detail.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vision">
        <h5>Vision</h5>
        
        
        <p><em>&quot;Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come&quot;</em> - Victor Hugo</p>
        <p>On its own, no amount of insight will do anything other than reveal the situation as it already is. The imagination to renew strategic vision at the limits of what is possible is also required, alongside open-minded, lateral enquiry to discover interventions with real potential to create prosperity in a complex, changing world.</p>
        <p>Novel approaches that provide demonstrable, measurable benefits elsewhere can be skilfully translated to meet specific local challenges, offering compelling evidence-based change narratives capable of catalysing active stakeholder engagement around concrete opportunities for collaborative impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="impact">
        <h5>Impact</h5>
        <p><em>&quot;Ideas change the course of history&quot;</em> - John Maynard Keynes</p>
        <p>Effective impact intervention to implement renewed vision depends on inclusive future-oriented thought leadership to facilitate common purpose around new, incentivising ideas. Previously intractable challenges can become opportunities to establish new alignments around productive innovation, driving constructive change.</p>
        <p>Participative methodologies which systematically test and measure repeatable, real-world outcomes help avoid blue pie in the sky thinking and support solutions brokerage by demonstrating how a better world looks in practice. They also provide for potential export of successful interventions.</p>
        <p>Decision-makers and wider consultation process participants gain better understanding of local problems and their potential solutions, organisations benefit from greater strategic alignment and cross-sector collaboration, and more inclusive economic policies distribute prosperity more equally and enhance regional resilience for all.</p>

    <h4>Participatory action research</h4>
    <p>Greater Exeter CIC employs reflexive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_action_research">participatory action research</a> methods to ensure stakeholder perspectives and preferences are incorporated in individual projects and at organisational and methodological level.</p>
    <p>The aim is to challenge the status quo while recognising its strengths; advocate strategic direction which acknowledges risk and uncertainty; maintain vision without losing sight of detail; explore leading-edge options alongside established solutions; and remain critically reflective while favouring bold, experimental action.</p>
    <p>A wide range of research and advocacy tools are available to help achieve these aims. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>stakeholder mapping and channel monitoring to facilitate engagement and information exchange</li>
        <li>horizon scanning for emerging practices, standout ideas and innovative solutions</li>
        <li>collaborative policy and practice development in roundtable discussions and focus groups</li>
        
        <li>community participatory budgeting and planning facilitation</li>
        <li>evidence-gathering via desk-based and field research, personal interviews and sample surveys</li>
        <li>dissemination events including seminars, presentations, meetings and workshops</li>
        <li>research and policy briefings, reports and papers, editorial content and news updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Outputs are framed as potential social, economic and political capital to help leverage strategic interest alignment among key actors, and community interest is ensured through continuous feedback.</p>

    <h4>Single issues, complex systems</h4>
    
    <p>The whole regional policy puzzle cannot be solved with a single move. There are, moreover, competing views of what it looks like when complete. Nevertheless, a complex systems approach is necessary to avoid the limiting single-sector focus that characterises much current policy research and practice.</p>
    <p>Greater Exeter CIC accordingly seeks to deal with issues individually, at appropriate spatial scale and with suitable sectoral scope, while recognising their unique position in the larger scheme. The interdependency of each piece of the puzzle is then framed and resolved at the whole picture level of place. Each piece renders essential detail that cannot be captured in overarching vision without losing sight of important information. As each piece is placed, the emergent image offers an impression of the whole landscape.</p>
    <p>Social, economic and political agency is distributed across the landscape in the same way as the shapes and colours of self-similar pieces fit together to complete the puzzle. The frequency with which actors play individual parts in multiple contexts is reflected in interconnections that are visible everywhere.</p>
    <p>When a particular piece is correctly located, the solution it represents offers potential insight into another similar problem elsewhere. Interventions thus combine across many places at multiple scales with complex whole system impact. Local action <em>can</em> solve global challenges.</p>

    <h4>Exeter St James regeneration</h4>
    <p>City knowledge economy development critically depends on the presence of creative, technically-skilled young entrepreneurial talent which, whether locally-grown or graduating, is currently more likely to leave Exeter than stay. Increasing the supply of low-cost, centrally-located accommodation would help improve retention rates while also attracting dynamic incomers who currently head elsewhere to start companies, join growth enterprises and stimulate cultural and night-time economies.</p>
    <p>Exeter St James contains plenty of the kind of investment-ready human scale housing stock with family home potential which appeals to these aspirational groups, and is often readily available in competing knowledge economy growth areas. However, much of it is occupied on a part-time basis by university undergraduates, who have little incentive to get involved with the city's long-term development.</p>
    <p>This project is focussed on the intersection of current student accommodation and residency patterns, existing university campus and nearby street car parking arrangements and consequent congestion impacts, planned city cycling infrastructure development, prospective local authority revenue changes and special Article 4 directive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_in_multiple_occupation">HMO</a> licensing provisions.</p>
    <p>It aims to stimulate new housing supply of the right kind in the right place to support city centre knowledge economy development while enabling important mobility changes, supplying economic benefits to retail, leisure and culture businesses and increasing council tax receipts. It proposes a progressive regeneration approach that needs no public investment and takes place incementally, achieving positive outcomes without creating negative impacts.</p>

    <h4>Enabling greater civic participation</h4>
    <p>Public policy is decided and delivered by many overlapping local, regional, national and international authorities with often conflicting political perspectives and strategic interests. Many other powerful, yet unaccountable, institutions and actors also influence and make decisions which affect us all.</p>
    <p>Democratic deficits have increased as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life">standards in public life</a> have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_scandals_in_the_United_Kingdom">declined</a>, while changes in the structure, ownership, role and reach of print and digital media have weakened the capacity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate">Fourth Estate</a> to scrutinise, investigate and report these issues. Social media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)">echo chamber</a> effects also contribute to the UK's poor performance in <a href="http://repository.upenn.edu/think_tanks/12/">authoritative</a> <a href="https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016">transparency</a> and <a href="http://www.democraticaudit.com/the-2017-audit-of-uk-democracy/">democracy</a> audits.</p>
    <p>Active civic participation, an important remedy for these ills, critically depends on citizens understanding complex, often distributed decision-making processes while also being sufficiently well-informed about what is taking place to engage and intervene. Low population densities, multiple local authorities and electoral displacement, among other issues, make this a particular challenge across Greater Exeter.</p>
    <p>This project aims to enable more inclusive participation in regional strategic policy development and implementation by increasing public understanding of and encouraging collaborative engagement with local deliberation and decision-making.</p>
    <p>This will include producing guides to major local institutions and their roles, explanations of major policy documents and their interdependencies and sources of news and information about key events and processes. Salient facts and figures selected to facilitate debate will be highlighted. A series of workshops and seminars to guide community advocacy groups and local social change organisations through this terrain and train them in communications strategy development is also planned.</p>

<article id="productivity-and-place-a-special-case">
    <h4>Productivity &amp; place - a special case</h4>
    <p>Productivity is an inappropriate comparator between dense conurbations and rural areas with much lower population densities but often much higher environmental and life quality. Were population density externalised as an explicit variable in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_value_added">GVA</a> calculations, for example, and other important factors such as air quality similarly included, then the <a href="http://heartofswlep.co.uk/">Heart of the South West</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_enterprise_partnership">Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP)</a> would score very differently in comparison with, for example, the <a href="http://westofenglandlep.co.uk/">West of England LEP</a>, now attracting significant public investment as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_of_England_Combined_Authority">West of England Combined Authority</a>. The contrast with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Combined_Authority">Greater Manchester</a> is even starker.</p>
    <p>More sophisticated comparisons of economic and other strengths and weaknesses, of which <a href="https://theconversation.com/beyond-gdp-are-there-better-ways-to-measure-well-being-33414">many</a> <a href="http://oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/5510#sthash.NA0dfsoa.dpuf">are</a> <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/five-measures-of-growth-that-are-better-than-gdp">available</a>, enable more innovative approaches to wider policy issues on a place-specific basis. Important strategic questions about the future direction of the region can be considered in terms which reflect its unique characteristics, rather than by crude comparisions with presumed competition in very different places.</p>
    <p>Even if such metrics are only employed locally to inform more insightful policy development, the resulting economic thinking would become more aligned with, for example, the "<a href="https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2016/10/to-shape-inclusive-growth-we-need-to-measure-it">Quality GVA</a>" outlined by the <a href="https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-services-and-communities-folder/inclusive-growth-commission">RSA Inclusive Growth Commission</a>, as well as the work of other significant social change organisations in specific places, such as the <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/connecting-major-development-jobs-skills-and-poverty-reduction-leeds-city-region">Joseph Rowntree Foundation in Leeds</a>.</p>
    <p>This offers opportunities not only to make a special, differentiating, place-based productivity case for Greater Exeter, but also to combine resources with other progressive initiatives to pursue new ways of understanding what more sustainable economic development, and the more equitable wealth and income distribution that goes with it, looks like in practice. This project aims to explore these options and their implications in detail.</p>

    <h4>Kickstarting Exeter's knowledge economy</h4>
    <p>Government policy promotes Exeter as a <a href="http://gw4.ac.uk/sww-sia/">centre for environmental futures</a> research and development, predicating the emergence of a local entrepreneurial innovation cluster on the presence of the new <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/2014/new-hpc">Met Office supercomputer</a> and <a href="https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/research/xcs/">specialists</a> at the <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/inspiring/keythemes/science/climate/">University of Exeter</a>. The <a href="http://innovationexeter.co.uk/">Innovation Exeter</a> initiative, <a href="http://www.exetersciencepark.co.uk/">Exeter Science Park</a> and the University of Exeter <a href="http://www.spaceforsuccess.co.uk/">Innovation Centre</a> have also been established in support of city knowledge economy development.</p>
    <p>Exeter has also been identified as a key <a href="http://technation.techcityuk.com/cluster/exeter/">centre of digital economy activity</a>, following rapid growth in small communications services businesses in the city in <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/tech-nation-2016">recent</a> <a href="http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tech%20Nation%202015.pdf">years</a>. However, the <a href="http://feweek.co.uk/2016/11/17/exeter-college-is-the-best-college-in-the-country-according-to-fe-weeks-new-league-table/">nationally</a> <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/theresa-may-pledges-ps170m-institutes-technology">successful</a> <a href="https://exe-coll.ac.uk/news/Article/Exeter-College-Celebrates-Best-Ever-A-Level-Results/538">Exeter</a> <a href="https://exe-coll.ac.uk/News/Article/Exeter-College-is-Celebrating-its-Best-Ever-Academic-Results/646">College</a> and <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_564975_en.html">Exeter Maths School</a> <a href="https://www.exe-coll.ac.uk/College/About/Achievements.aspx">facilitate</a> the <a href="https://www.exetermathematicsschool.ac.uk/results/">departure</a> of many of the region's most able young people, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/feb/04/brain-drain-which-uk-regions-hold-on-to-their-graduates">low</a> <a href="https://www.hecsu.ac.uk/assets/assets/documents/hecsu_graduate_migration_report_january_15.pdf">graduate retention rates</a> mean the city is <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/careers/research/careersinthesw/">short</a> of the resource it most needs to develop a local knowledge economy: <a href="http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Tech-Nation-Best-Practice-Hackney.pdf">youthful entrepreneurial talent</a>.</p>
    
    <p>So how realistic is a vision of significant knowledge economy growth in Exeter? Of what elements is such a sector <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster">essentially composed?</a> And can one be successfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_development">kickstarted</a> here in the absence of most typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration">agglomeration effect drivers</a> and with well-established competition both nearby and further afield?
    </p><p>This project aims to answer these questions with a detailed analysis of Greater Exeter's potential to compensate for lack of scale, density, proximity, markets and supply chains with the possibility of sectoral specilisation in social sciences and environmental futures alongside wider digital economy development driven by human intellectual capital attracted by economic, social and cultural opportunities.</p>

<article id="project-development-the-story-so-far">
    <h4>Project development - the story so far</h4>
    <p>Discussion about a place-based policy research and advocacy organisation focussed on the emerging Greater Exeter began in the summer of 2016, at the same time as <a href="https://www.gesp.org.uk/">several</a> <a href="http://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=1589">other</a> <a href="https://greaterexeterskills.com/">initiatives</a> were <a href="https://new.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/traffic-information/transport-planning/innovasump/">developing</a> <a href="https://exetercityfutures.com/">responses</a> to significant change in the region, and against a backdrop of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016">reorientation</a> and <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-07-18/HCWS94">reorganisation</a> in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/a-south-west-that-works-for-everybody">national</a> <a href="http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/an-elected-mayor-is-the-answer-to-devolution-ambitions-warns-javid/story-29829580-detail/story.html">policy</a> and <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/report/english-devolution-deals/">governance</a>. After several months of scoping research, Greater Exeter was  founded as a Community Interest Company in April 2017.</p>
    <p>A large pool of potential project consultants with locally-specific expertise covering a wide range of relevant sectors has been identified, many of whom have so far been successfully approached. A comprehensive range of peer organisations has also been selected for comparative analysis and context research.</p>
    <p>Six individual projects are currently being developed to act as an initial organisational shop window, with three more outlined and a wealth of ideas in the pipeline. An introductory website summarises aims, approach and initial project focus and social media is being employed to develop wider project-related networks.</p>
    <p>A period of further stakeholder soundings is now underway. The intention is to explore the interests and respond to the concerns of potential supporters and collaborators, as well as critics, adapting the project's approach accordingly. Research into funding opportunities is also taking place, and a business model is being built. The initiative is still at an early stage of growth, and is actively seeking contributors across the region.</p>
    
    
    <p>Comment, contributions or other constructive interventions are invited from anyone who lives or works in Greater Exeter and will inform ongoing practice and project development.</p>
